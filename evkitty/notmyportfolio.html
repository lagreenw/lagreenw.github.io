    <h1>~ About Me ~</h1>
    <p>I am a multimedia artist, musician, and student based in Los Angeles and Washington State. In 2013 I started the band, RCV, which I currently manage, write, record, and perform with. In 2018 I began studying at the University of Southern California as a Media Arts + Practice (BA) major. My program focuses on interdisciplinary, socially-minded, and forward thinking approaches to media creation and analysis - which is great for me because I have too many interests to count!</p>
    <p>Although my portfolio website is currently under construction, please feel free to browse the links below for a couple examples of my work, and/or contact me at the email provided!</p>
