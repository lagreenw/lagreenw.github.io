    <h1>~ Foreword ~</h1>
    <p>At The University of Southern California’s “Everybody’s Kitchen” dining hall, there lives a cat who the students lovingly refer to as EVKitty. While the origins of EVKitty remain a hotly debated mystery, there are reports of seeing her there as far back as 2009. In Fall of 2019, however, EVKitty suddenly vanished and has yet to be seen since. The absence she has left behind cannot be overstated. You see, as the communal pet of the Trojan family, EVKitty means an incredible amount to students like me. Of course we miss the fuzziness of her toes, the green of her eyes, and the girth of her belly (which is SUBSTANTIAL). But beyond that, we miss the wisdom she imparted on us. No matter what kind of day a student was having - full of stress, sleep deprivation, self-doubt, homesickness, loneliness... you name it! - EVKitty was always there as a reminder of the simpler pleasures in life. In her soft little way, EVKitty would jump in your lap and ask you to slow down - enjoy the sun, eat some Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and put things in perspective. She didn’t just love her fellow Trojans, but demanded that they love themselves. EVKitty is a teacher, a symbol, and a family member. EVKitty is my friend.</p>

    <p>I made this game to honor and immortalize our beloved cat, and to speculate on where she might have gone. For those who have loved her, I hope this game helps you to keep her memory alive. As for those who have never had the pleasure of meeting EVKitty, I hope this might serve as your introduction.</p>
    <p>EVKitty - If you have somehow developed the ability to read english, access the internet, and are reading this right now, please know that you are dearly missed. While we will never give up awaiting your return, we hope wherever you are is somewhere extraordinary - filled with food, naps, and cuddles galore. You have served our community well. Now be free, EVKitty!<br/>
    Yours truly,<br/>
    - Luke</p>
