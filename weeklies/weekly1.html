    <h1>Weekly #1 - The Mechanism of Meaning</h1>
    <img src="image/DiagramDefinition.png" />
    <p>Diagrams are a way of visualizing a certain function or set of information. Because of my broad definition, I see maps and networks as types of diagrams. Diagrams can be used to illustrate statistical data, physical rules, arguments, theories, geography, systems, etc. While diagrams are sometimes thought of as objectively storing information, their visual construction can change meaning in profound and nuanced ways. Gins and Arakawa push the limits of diagramic art with <i>The Mechanism of Meaning</i>. This work proves how diagrams can effectively be used for abstract conceptual art and promote highly subjective (meditative) meaning making in their viewers. This challenges the traditional goal of a diagram: to communicate in straight-forward and simplistic terms.</p>
