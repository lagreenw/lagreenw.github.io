    <h1>Weekly #4</h1>
    <p>I was shocked to hear people describe nature as being in a state of constant, unpredictable change. I had always taken the idea that nature was self-balancing for granted. My understanding of the problem described in the previous episode was that nature really is perfectly self-regulating, but that our attempt to re-create that order in our society through the use of computers was flawed because people programmed them with imperfectly selfish agendas. Now I understand that nature was never really the model we wanted because it was never truly harmonious. Humans, and other organisms that comprise the natural world, do not behave like machines because they do not respond to feedback loops in consistently predictable ways. The ideologies that fundamentally shape an intelligent organism’s action, or “re-action” to feedback loops, are always changing in ways that are currently unmodelable with computers. Even AI systems, which to my understanding are essentially just an evolution of Cybernetics, are not truly intelligent to me because they do not have the feelings and irrationality of natural intelligent organisms. Our technology is not nearly complex enough yet to be used to describe reality accurately or simulate a truly intelligent system.</p>
