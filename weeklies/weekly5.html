    <h1>Weekly #5 - Foucault & Postscript on the Societies of Control</h1>
    <p>To Foucalt, itâ€™s not the people in positions of political power OR the people with economic power who have power over society as a whole. Instead he believes true power lies in the ability to dictate the structures/vocab that people use to understand the world. In other words, if you dictate how people think of themselves, the vocab they have to describe things, and the concepts people have of reality, you have the power to change the system. This relates to the concept of post-structuralism, which understands that meaning is limited by the systems we have to understand it, like language. If you can change the system of understanding, you can open new spaces of meaning (ex: creating new words to describe gender allows individuals to understand themselves in ways that more closely reflect who they are).</p>
